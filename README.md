## Settings

See [List of all available settings](https://github.com/fxmorin/carpet-fixes/wiki/Available-Settings)

## ModPacks
Go for it! I absolutely don't mind as long as you mention that the mod is in the modpack.  

## More detail
This mod works for both Singleplayer & Multiplayer, although it only modifies server-side functionality!  
The mod does fix some client-side bugs (not many), and only if carpet-fixes is on the server as well.
